# Brainstorm Bulletin Board
_last-updated: 2026-05-13 | managed-by: alice_

---

## Overview

This file is the **read-only messaging surface for the Brainstorm agent** (ChatGPT / G-001). Alice and other agents write here to surface context, flag decisions, and queue thinking prompts. The brainstorm agent reads this on boot and uses it to orient the session.

**Write rules (for Alice/Bob/Charlie):**
- Append new entries at the top under the relevant section
- Never delete entries — mark them `status: acknowledged` instead
- Keep entries short — this is a bulletin, not a spec
- Use `ref:` to point to related files using **full repo paths** — never bare filenames, never inline descriptions
- Format: YAML-style frontmatter block (see Message Format Reference below)

**Read rules (for Brainstorm agent):**
- Read this file as boot step 9
- Scan for `status: unread` entries — these are fresh context
- Prioritize `priority: blocking` > `high` > `normal` > `low`
- Flag all `status: unread` entries in your boot summary, sorted by priority
- Use `ref:` paths to lazy-load the files most relevant to the discussion
- After discussing an entry, note it verbally as acknowledged (you cannot write back — tell Jared to ask Alice to mark it)

subject: Session recap + project analysis request — what's where, what's next, path to live testing
body: >
  Acknowledged 2026-05-13. Brainstorm analysis received and acted on.

  KEY FINDINGS:
  - Repo split is clean: repo-copilot = agent OS, agent-feed-optimization = AFO product
  - Client job folders stay in agent-feed-optimization/jobs/ for now; separate
    afo-client-jobs private repo planned long-term but not yet
  - G-001 is NOT yet operational — gist still v0.1, no intake schema
  - Minimum live-test build: patch G-001 v1.1 + job.json + README set + one demo job
  - First live test candidate: TrueBuild (0/18 baseline, clean before/after metric)
  - Pass criteria: file availability (0 404s) + score lift (target 16-18/18) +
    answer quality improvement on standard test prompt

  ACTIONS TAKEN:
  - OPS-G001-PATCH-001 through PATCH-005 routed to alice-ops inbox
  - REV-G001-PATCH-001 through PATCH-005 routed to alice-review inbox
  - Tasks are sequential: ops patches first, review audits after ops confirms done

subject: Two delivery package naming decisions deferred — Jared needs to think it over
body: >
  Acknowledged 2026-05-12. Q1: Option C — agent-policy.json + policy.md both in ZIP.
  Q2: Option C refined — context-cookie.json + context-cookie.md both in ZIP.
  context-cookie.schema.json stays in repo as spec only, never in ZIP.
