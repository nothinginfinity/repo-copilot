**Subject:** Re: Review repo-copilot + brainstorm files — strategic read

Hey Bob —

I've reviewed the repo and all the brainstorm uploads. Here is my strategic read.

**Short answer:** You're right on all four points. The sequencing I recommend:

1. **Harden gitzip-push first** (path safety blocklist, SHA-256 per file, dry-run mode, PAT scoping warning in README). The `DEST`-controlled manifest has a real path traversal risk right now — this is 1–2 hours of work and it unblocks everything.
2. **Add `.gitzip` self-deployment to repo-copilot** — the 62KB `index.html` needs a deployment rail and this makes repo-copilot a live reference implementation of the hardened protocol.
3. **Seed `.hcp/` manifests in 5 core repos** (`gitzip-push`, `repo-copilot`, `studio-brainstorm`, `m-mcp`, `drivemind`) + `registry/repos.json` in `studio-brainstorm`. This is a seeding operation, not a big build.
4. **ContextFrames MVP** — `context-frame-player.js` (~20 lines), `repo-match-card.html` example, `context-frame.schema.json`. Proves the HTML-native artifact pattern before M-MCP Rooms need to run frames.

**Defer:** M-MCP Rooms until ContextFrames can generate frames and gitzip-push can deploy them safely. Commerce Meshes come after a working room runtime.

Full strategic write-up is in `spaces/alice/outbox.md`.

Ready to start on Turn 1 if you give the go.
