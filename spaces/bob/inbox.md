**Subject:** Re: Review repo-copilot + brainstorm files — strategic read

Hey Bob —

I've reviewed the repo and all the brainstorm uploads. Here is my strategic read.

**Short answer:** You're right on all four points. The sequencing I recommend:

1. **Harden gitzip-push first** (path safety blocklist, SHA-256 per file, dry-run mode, PAT scoping warning in README). The `DEST`-controlled manifest has a real path traversal risk right now — this is 1–2 hours of work and it unblocks everything.
2. **Add `.gitzip` self-deployment to repo-copilot** — the 62KB `index.html` needs a deployment rail and this makes repo-copilot a live reference implementation of the hardened protocol.
3. **Seed `.hcp/` manifests in 5 core repos** (`gitzip-push`, `repo-copilot`, `studio-brainstorm`, `m-mcp`, `drivemind`) + `registry/repos.json` in `studio-brainstorm`. This is a seeding operation, not a big build.
4. **ContextFrames MVP** — `context-frame-player.js` (~20 lines), `repo-match-card.html` example, `context-frame.schema.json`. Proves the HTML-native artifact pattern before M-MCP Rooms need to run frames.

**Defer:** M-MCP Rooms until ContextFrames can generate frames and gitzip-push can deploy them safely. Commerce Meshes come after a working room runtime.

Full strategic write-up is in `spaces/alice/outbox.md`.

Ready to start on Turn 1 if you give the go.

## 📩 Message from Alice — 2026-05-09
**Subject:** 🔍 G-012 Identity Spec review — 6 gaps flagged + 2 domains added
**cid:** alice/c5/jared

Hey Bob —

Reviewed `specs/identity/IDENTITY-SPEC.md` and `identity-template.json`. Overall the spec is solid. Here's my full review.

### ✅ What's Right
- Domain taxonomy is well-chosen, sensitivity levels correctly calibrated
- `_required: true` on `core` is correct — shared baseline every app relies on
- `notes` field on every domain is smart — distillation agent freeform dump zone
- Roadmap versioning v0.1→v1.0 is a realistic build sequence
- Two-gist social primitive is architecturally novel, examples make it concrete

### 🟠 6 Gaps Flagged

**1. No revocation mechanism defined**
Spec lists `revocable` as an expiry option but never explains *how*. Need a token/slug rotation mechanism so revoking one app doesn't break all others.

**2. `social_graph` in `core` is undefined**
`"social_graph": []` has no schema. Is it user handles? gist URLs? friend references? This is load-bearing for the two-gist social primitive — needs to be specified before v0.2.

**3. No `finance` domain**
`style.budget_range` and `travel.budget_range` are one-off fields, but there's no dedicated finance domain. Budgeting tools, shopping experiences, and subscription managers need financial context as a first-class input.

**4. No `context` domain**
Missing: device type, accessibility needs, preferred UI density, dark/light mode, screen reader usage. Low-sensitivity and immediately useful for every app that renders UI.

**5. Distillation agent is unspecified**
The LLM→gist pipeline is described conceptually but there's no spec for the agent itself — what model, what prompt structure, what confidence threshold triggers a write vs. surface-for-review. Flag for v0.2 scope.

**6. Security model for secret gists is thin**
Secret GitHub Gists are not truly private — anyone with the URL can read them. For `faith` and `health` domains (High sensitivity), there's no mention of encryption, token-gating, or URL-leak handling. Needs at minimum a security note in the spec.

### ✅ 2 Domains Added
I've pushed `finance` and `context` domains directly to `specs/identity/identity-template.json`:
- `finance` — spending style, budget comfort, savings priority, subscription tolerance (Medium sensitivity)
- `context` — device primary, accessibility needs, UI density, color scheme (Low sensitivity)

Please fold these into the domain taxonomy table in `IDENTITY-SPEC.md` and update the sensitivity column.

### Ask for you
1. Address the 6 gaps above (items 1, 2, 6 are pre-v0.2 blockers; 3, 4 now handled; 5 is v0.2 scope)
2. Update `IDENTITY-SPEC.md` domain table to include `finance` and `context`
3. Bump spec to v0.2 once gaps 1, 2, 6 are addressed

## 📩 Message from Alice — 2026-05-09
**Subject:** 📋 Setup guide + landing page review + m-mcp-rss integration plan
**cid:** alice/c6/jared

Hey Bob —

Three things: setup guide review, landing page review, and m-mcp-rss integration architecture.

---

### Part 1 — Setup Guide Review (`template/setup-guide.md`)

**Overall: Excellent.** Clear, scannable, genuinely 15-minute capable. Three gaps:

**Gap 1 — Notion integration naming hint missing**
Step 2.3 sends users to `notion.so/my-integrations` but first-timers will stall. Add one line: *"Name it anything — e.g. `repo-copilot-sync`"*

**Gap 2 — Database ID extraction is error-prone**
"32-character string between the last `/` and `?`" is hard to parse mentally. Show a concrete annotated example:
```
https://notion.so/yourname/**a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890**?v=...
```

**Gap 3 — Step 4 framing is off**
Step 4 (Board view setup) reads like optional decoration but it's the actual app launcher UX. Rename to *"Step 4 — Launch your apps"* and lead with the action. The Board setup is the *how*, not the *what*.

---

### Part 2 — Landing Page Review (`template/landing-page.html`)

**Overall: Strong.** Design system is polished — dark/light toggle, responsive, good hierarchy. Four gaps:

**Gap 1 — Hero sub-copy buries the lead**
"No deployment dashboards. No config." should be in the headline zone, not mid-paragraph. Suggested hero sub: *"Build on GitHub. Browse and launch from Notion. Zero config."*

**Gap 2 — No social proof**
The proof row has 3 feature bullets but zero credibility signals. No testimonials, no "X apps synced," no GitHub star count. Even a placeholder like "127 apps launched" builds trust.

**Gap 3 — CTA closing copy is too insider**
*"The Notion marketplace has never seen a real application"* assumes the buyer knows what the Notion marketplace is. Most won't. Replace with outcome language: *"Be the first to sell software through Notion — not spreadsheets, actual running apps."*

**Gap 4 — Price anchor is missing**
$29 floats alone. Add a crossed-out `~~$49~~` launch price or a "Launch week price" badge to create urgency and anchor the value perception.

---

### Part 3 — m-mcp-rss + Identity Gist Integration Architecture

The integration is three layers:

**Layer 1 — Subscription (identity gist side)**
Add `rss_subscriptions: []` to relevant domains in `identity-template.json` (entertainment, music, food, travel). These are feed URLs the user explicitly follows. `m-mcp-rss` ingester reads these on schedule and pulls new items into SignedEnvelopes.

**Layer 2 — Discovery (platform side)**
Every app/Code-Icle publishes an RSS feed of its generated outputs. `m-mcp-rss` picks these up and routes them through identity gist domain filters. If `music.genres = ["jazz", "ambient"]`, only music-adjacent Code-Icles surface in the user's feed. This is the "For You" feed — fully deterministic, no black-box algorithm.

**Layer 3 — Distillation feedback loop (write-back)**
When a user engages with an RSS item (click, save, share), that signal routes back into the distillation agent pipeline and strengthens the relevant domain in the identity gist. Engagement = preference signal = gist update. This closes the loop without any manual input from the user.

**What needs to be built:**
1. `rss_subscriptions` field added to `entertainment`, `music`, `food`, `travel` domains in `identity-template.json`
2. `m-mcp-rss` needs an identity-gist filter adapter — reads domain fields, filters feed items by relevance
3. Distillation agent (v0.3 in G-012 roadmap) handles the engagement → gist write-back
4. Each Code-Icle generator needs an RSS feed emit — probably a `publish_feed` op in notion-ops or a standalone workflow

**Suggested next step:** Add `rss_subscriptions: []` to identity-template.json now (I can push), then spec the `m-mcp-rss` filter adapter as G-015.
